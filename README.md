# Going-to-Boston
Going to Boston is a dice game between two people. The number of rolls depends on the number of die available. In this  Javaâ„¢ version, the user plays against a computer, and there are 3 die, meaning only 3 rolls.
The user will go first, rolling all three die, and keeping the highest one. The user then rolls again with the two die left, and again, keeps the highest one. Finally, the user rolls the last die and keeps whatever it lands on. The user's score for that round is the sum of the rolls. After the user rolls, the computer rolls with the exact same rules as the user. If at any point, more than one die roll on the same number, then one of the die is chosen to be kept, and the round continues. At the end of the round, whoever has the higher sum wins. The user has the option to play as many rounds as they want, and the score for each individual round is kept. At the end of the game, the user can choose to leave the game, and the console will display whether they won or lost.
